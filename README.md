The sales analytics report provides detailed insights into customer performance and market performance vs sales targets. It enables businesses to monitor and evaluate their sales activities, identify patterns, and track key performance indicators (KPIs). The report helps determine effective customer discounts, facilitate negotiations, and identify potential business expansion opportunities.

The finance analytics report includes Profit and Loss (P&L) statements by fiscal year, months, and markets. It aids in evaluating financial performance, supports decision-making, and facilitates communication with stakeholders. The finance report helps in benchmarking against industry peers and previous periods, providing a foundation for budgeting and forecasting.

Key insights from the sales analysis include:

- The PC division experienced significant growth, with sales increasing from $40.1 million in 2020 to $165.8 million in 2021
- Accessories and peripherals saw a massive 321.5% increase in sales, growing from $105.2 million to $338.4 million
- Networking and storage products also performed well, with sales rising from $51.4 million to $94.7 million (184.4% increase)

The project utilized various technical skills, including ETL methodology, Power Query for date table generation, Power Pivot for data model relationships, and DAX for calculated columns. It also developed soft skills such as report design, optimization, and systematic approach to report building.
